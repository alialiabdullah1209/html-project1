<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> As a passionate software student, I'm diving deep into the world of web development. I love the challenge of turning creative ideas into functional, user-friendly websites. For me, the real magic lies in bridging the gap between a creative vision and a tangible, interactive digital experience I'm currently honing my skills across the full stack, from crafting pixel-perfect interfaces with HTML and CSS to building dynamic logic with JavaScript. I believe that clean code and a user-centric approach are the foundation for building something amazing from scratch, and I'm always excited to learn new technologies to solve real-world problems.</p>
